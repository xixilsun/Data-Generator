The code in your `FrmMain.vb` file is functional, but there are several areas where it could be optimized and improved for better readability, maintainability, and performance. Here's an analysis and some suggestions:

### 1. **Code Organization**
   - **Modularization:** The `FrmMain_Load` method contains a lot of logic. This can be broken down into smaller methods to improve readability and maintenance. For example, initializing event handlers, loading initial data, and preparing the GridView could be separate methods.
   - **Use of Inline SQL:** Consider abstracting SQL queries into a data access layer or stored procedures instead of embedding them directly in the code. This helps with separation of concerns and makes the code easier to test.

### 2. **Event Handlers**
   - **Commented Code:** There are several lines of code that are commented out. If these are no longer needed, it would be better to remove them. If they are needed for future reference, consider using proper version control to track changes instead of leaving commented-out code in the production file.
   - **Event Handler Attachments:** Event handlers are attached within `FrmMain_Load`. While this is acceptable, it can clutter the load method. Consider creating a separate method just for attaching event handlers.

### 3. **Error Handling**
   - **Try-Catch Blocks:** Error handling is done using `Try-Catch` blocks in some places, which is good. However, it's important to ensure that every potential point of failure, especially in database calls and file operations, is properly handled to avoid unexpected crashes.

### 4. **Data Access**
   - **DataTable Usage:** You're using `DataTable` extensively, which is fine, but consider if using more strongly-typed collections or even ORM tools like Entity Framework could make the code more robust and easier to work with.
   - **SQL Injection Risks:** Ensure that the SQL strings like those in `PrepareDataset` are not vulnerable to SQL injection. Always use parameterized queries to avoid this risk.

### 5. **UI and UX Improvements**
   - **Responsive UI:** Consider if there are operations, like `ProcessGenerateData`, that could be offloaded to background threads to keep the UI responsive.
   - **Progress Updates:** You're already updating progress in `ProcessGenerateData`, which is good. Ensure that the UI remains responsive during heavy processing and that progress updates are frequent enough to be useful to the user.

### 6. **Performance**
   - **Data Loading:** When loading data into controls like ComboBoxes or GridViews, ensure that only necessary data is loaded, especially if the data sets are large. Consider paging or lazy loading techniques.
   - **Loop Optimization:** There are several loops where data is processed row by row. Depending on the data size, this could be optimized further, possibly through parallel processing or using more efficient data structures.

### 7. **Maintainability**
   - **Magic Strings and Numbers:** Avoid the use of magic strings and numbers (e.g., `"Random"` or `9999999`). These should be defined as constants or enumerations.
   - **Documentation:** Consider adding more comments or XML documentation to explain the purpose of complex methods and business logic.

### 8. **Best Practices**
   - **Naming Conventions:** Ensure that all methods, variables, and controls follow consistent naming conventions that reflect their purpose.
   - **Type Safety:** VB.NET is a type-safe language. Avoid using generic objects when a more specific type can be used, as this enhances clarity and reduces runtime errors.

### Conclusion
The file appears to be functional, but there are several areas where it can be optimized for performance, readability, and maintainability. By modularizing the code, ensuring proper error handling, and following best practices, the codebase can be significantly improved. Consider these suggestions to refine and enhance your application.
