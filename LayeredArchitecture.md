The core functionality of your `FrmMain` code revolves around creating and managing a data generation tool within a Windows Forms application. The main tasks performed by this form include loading and setting up a user interface, preparing datasets, handling user interactions, and generating SQL insert queries based on the data prepared. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core functionalities, along with examples directly from the code:

### 1. **UI Initialization and Event Handling**
   - The `FrmMain_Load` method is responsible for initializing the form when it is loaded. It sets up various event handlers for user interactions, prepares default values, and loads the database list.
   - **Example:**
     ```vb
     AddHandler cboDatabase.SelectedIndexChanged, AddressOf OnDBSelectedIndexChanged
     AddHandler btnGenerate.Click, AddressOf ProcessGenerateData
     AddHandler btnPrepareDataset.Click, AddressOf PrepareDataset
     ```

### 2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - The `PrepareDataset` method handles the preparation of the dataset based on the selected database and table. It retrieves column information and sets default values for categories and subcategories.
   - **Example:**
     ```vb
     Dim Sql = "SELECT COLUMN_NAME AS ColumnName, ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS C ... WHERE TABLE_NAME = " & SqlStr(SelectedTable)
     Dim Dt As DataTable = GetDataTable(Sql, GetConnectionString(SelectedDatabase))
     dtDataSet.Rows.Clear()

     For Each row In Dt.Rows
         'Set default category & subcategory
         Dim DefaultCategory As String = ""
         Dim DefaultSubcategory As String = ""
         ' ... Additional logic ...
         dtDataSet.Rows.Add(dr)
     Next
     ```

### 3. **SQL Insert Query Generation**
   - The `ProcessGenerateData` method is responsible for generating the SQL insert queries based on the prepared dataset. It iterates over the dataset and constructs the SQL statements to be inserted into the database.
   - **Example:**
     ```vb
     For Each row In dtDataSet.Rows
         dtOutput.Columns.Add(row!ColumnName, System.Type.GetType("System.String"))
         col.Add(row!ColumnName)
     Next

     For i As Integer = 0 To numQty.Value - 1
         Dim ParamList As New List(Of String)
         For Each Row In dtDataSet.Rows
             Dim RandomResult As String = GenerateFakeData(...)
             ParamList.Add(RandomResult)
         Next
         dtOutput.Rows.Add(ParamList.ToArray)
     Next
     ```

### 4. **Validation**
   - The `ValidateGenerate` and `ValidateRow` methods ensure that the data being generated is valid according to predefined rules. They check for empty fields, mismatched categories, and other potential errors before data generation.
   - **Example:**
     ```vb
     Private Function ValidateRow(rowHandle As Integer) As Boolean
         Dim View As GridView = gv
         View.FocusedRowHandle = rowHandle
         Dim ColumnName As String = If(View.GetRowCellValue(rowHandle, "ColumnName")?.ToString, String.Empty)
         ' ... Additional validation logic ...
         If String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(ColumnName) Then
             MsgBox("ColumnName must not be empty.", MsgBoxStyle.Critical)
             View.SetColumnError(View.Columns("ColumnName"), "ColumnName must not be empty.", DXErrorProvider.ErrorType.Critical)
             Return False
         End If
     End Function
     ```

### 5. **Data Handling and GridView Customization**
   - The code includes methods like `OnParameterChanged`, `OnGridViewCustomRowCellEditForEditing`, and `Gv_RowCellStyle` to handle user interactions with the GridView, such as updating the appearance based on data values and customizing how cells are edited.
   - **Example:**
     ```vb
     Private Sub Gv_RowCellStyle(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RowCellStyleEventArgs)
         Dim view As GridView = CType(sender, GridView)
         If e.Column.FieldName = "Setting" Then
             Dim ParameterValue As Object = view.GetRowCellValue(e.RowHandle, "Parameter")
             ' ... Additional logic ...
             e.Appearance.BackColor = Color.LightYellow
         End If
     End Sub
     ```

This code primarily focuses on allowing users to prepare datasets, generate corresponding SQL queries, and customize their data generation process through a dynamic and responsive UI.
